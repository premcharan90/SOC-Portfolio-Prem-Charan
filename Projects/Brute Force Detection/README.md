Project 2: Brute Force Detection using Wazuh

Objective: To detect and analyze brute force login attempts using SIEM correlation logic and simulated attack techniques.

Tools Used:

- Wazuh SIEM

- Kali Linux

- Windows Target VM

- Hydra

Implementation Steps:

- Enabled RDP on Windows target system

- Simulated brute force attack using Hydra

= Monitored login failures in SIEM

- Correlated repeated failures to identify brute force behavior

- Documented detection logic and incident response

Results:

- Successfully detected brute force attack behavior

- Demonstrated SIEM correlation capability

- Identified malicious IP and attack pattern

- Skills Demonstrated:

= Attack simulation

- Detection engineering

- SIEM analysis

- Incident documentation
