# Malware Analysis Report – AsyncRAT

## 1. Summary
AsyncRAT is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that enables an attacker to fully control an infected machine.  
This analysis is performed using **metadata-only**, without downloading or executing the malware.  
Data was collected from public sandbox reports (VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, Any.Run).

The analyzed AsyncRAT sample exhibits:
- Command & control communication
- Persistence via registry
- Keylogging and system monitoring
- File modification capabilities
- Process injection behavior

## 3. Technical Findings

### ✔ Command & Control (C2)
- Connects to: **peacezoneflow.ydns.eu**
- IP: **195.24.236.70**
- Protocol: **HTTP over port 80**
- Purpose: Remote command execution, data exfiltration

### ✔ Dropped Files
C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\Temp~DF47324D653E6FA617.TMP

Likely used as a staging component or payload loader.

### ✔ Registry Persistence
Creates the following Run key to ensure execution on startup:
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Run\svhost


### ✔ Process Injection
The malware attempts to inject itself into legitimate Windows processes to hide execution.

### ✔ Additional Behavior
- Keylogging
- Screenshot capture
- System information gathering
- File upload/download from infected host
- Encrypted C2 communication

## 5. Recommendations

### 🚨 Immediate Actions
- Block outbound traffic to **195.24.236.70** and **peacezoneflow.ydns.eu**
- Terminate active RAT processes
- Remove persistence registry key:
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Run\svhost


### 🔐 System Cleanup
- Delete dropped files
- Reset user credentials (RATs often capture credentials)
- Run a full AV/EDR scan on infected endpoints

### 🛡 Hardening & Prevention
- Implement application whitelisting
- Enable advanced PowerShell logging
- Deploy network-based C2 detection rules
- Train employees on attachment-based threats (RATs often spread via phishing)

## 6. Conclusion
This AsyncRAT sample demonstrates fully capable RAT behavior including C2 communication, persistence, data collection, and process injection.  
The extracted IOCs provide actionable intelligence for blocking, threat hunting, and improving detection logic within a SOC environment.
